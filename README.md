The Digital Signature System (DSS) is a simple Python application that demonstrates how digital signatures work using RSA encryption. It allows users to generate a self-signed certificate, sign text messages with a private key, and verify those signatures using the corresponding public key from the certificate. This helps ensure the authenticity and integrity of the message. The program features a menu-driven interface and is ideal for learning or experimenting with basic public-key cryptography concepts.
